# landing-page

This README file will serve as a log/ diary for my progress on this project.

Pre-solution check 

I have completed the project to the best of my ability, below are some thoughts/ observations,

1. I should try not to dwell on exact measurements/ alignments to make them pixel perfect
2. I may have created more divs than needed but at the moment this is my way of compartmentalizing the various sections of the landing page
3. My CSS doesn't feel very efficient. I am sure there are ways I can change this
4. Again, with spacing each section, there is probably a more efficient way to do this (I was doing it per section). Perhaps the solution will reveal something
5. I am not aware of a simple way to input an image and resize it without stretching/ distorting it. I will look into this in the solution
